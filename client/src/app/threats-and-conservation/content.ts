    label: "Declining Chinook Salmon Populations",
    problem:
      "Southern Residents rely almost entirely on Chinook salmon, which make up over 80% of their diet. But salmon numbers have plummeted due to overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change affecting spawning rivers.",
    impact:
      "With less food available, killer whales are experiencing malnutrition, weaker immune systems, and higher calf mortality rates. Starving whales are also more susceptible to disease and toxins.",
    solution:
      "Efforts to restore salmon populations include dam removals, habitat restoration projects, and stronger fishing regulations to protect Chinook stocks.",

  {
    label: "Noise & Disturbance from Boats",
    problem:
      "The Salish Sea is one of the busiest waterways in the world, with commercial shipping, whale-watching boats, and recreational vessels constantly moving through the whales’ habitat. The noise from these boats interferes with echolocation, making it harder for whales to find food.",
    impact:
      "Whales must work harder to communicate and hunt, burning more energy in the process. Increased stress levels can also impact reproduction. In some cases, whales have been injured or even killed by vessel strikes.",
    solution:
      "To help reduce noise and disturbance, speed restrictions and “quiet zones” have been introduced in key whale habitats. Regulations also require boats to keep a safe distance from the whales.",
  },
  {
    label: "Toxic Pollution & Contaminants",
    problem:
      "Industrial pollution has released harmful chemicals such as PCBs, pesticides, and flame retardants into the ocean. These toxins build up in the whales’ fat over time, creating serious health risks.",
    impact:
      "When food is scarce, whales burn their fat reserves, releasing stored toxins into their bodies. This weakens their immune systems and affects reproduction. Calves are particularly vulnerable, as they ingest high toxin levels through their mother’s milk.",

    solution:
      "Conservation efforts are focused on reducing industrial pollution, cleaning up toxic waste, and enforcing stronger environmental regulations to protect marine ecosystems.",
